# Discord Clone UI

This is the frontend for the [Discord Clone Nest](https://github.com/RamezTaher/Discord-2.0-back) project.

## Setting up the Frontend env

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
3. Create a `.env.development` file in the root directory and paste the following:

   ```
   VITE_API_URL=

   VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=

   ```

4. Run `yarn start` or `npm run start` depending on which package manager you use to start the project in development mode.
